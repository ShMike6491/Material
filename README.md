Our Universe App
--------------------------

This application will allow you to discover more about our universe, check out NASA daily posts. You can switch between the light or dark themes and find out many more.

Universe app is based on the material design principles. Here I was able to work with many different types of basic animations, learned more about material themes and tools. Also this application is built with MVVM architecture but the main purpose was to widen our experiences with UI Design.
